### Description

Create a webpage that simulates a sliding puzzle

For this project we will be using vanilla javascript to dynamically parse the image, render the puzzle pieces in real time, keep track of puzzle state

### MVP

By default, the app should allow a user to click on a tile and it move in a direction, until the puzzle reaches a win condition.

#### Wireframe

![wireframe](../wireframes/sliding-puzzle.jpg)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Process

##### Setup:

1. [Create GitHub repo (either online or locally)](../git-instructions.md), for example: `my-app`
2. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
3. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
4. Save all and create your first commit to `master`, **then** switch to a dev branch

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        style.css - main stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        main.js - main JavaScript file
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and directories, but you at least need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote
6. For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of `dev` onto a `new-feature` branch and create a PR into dev when complete

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Pass as input, any image for the puzzle app to upload to the site. This can be done with a drag and drop, or a "choose file" option, and should be able to happen at any time, not just once
2. Dynamically parse the uploaded image into a 4 x 4 equal sized square grid leaving the bottom left hand corner out.
3. Have a button that "shuffles" the board and that can be pressed at any time. This button should not accidentally solve the board.
4. Be able to click on any piece and if it is able to be moved into a new spot, move that piece, otherwise, do nothing.
5. If you click the final puzzle piece into place, the game should be able to display "winner" and let the user play again _and also_ allow the user to continue clicking the puzzle pieces to shuffle it themselves.
6. All image parsing must be done dynamically, including the win conditions. No hard coding.
7. Picture must be different on each tile

#### Additional Requirements

- Website must be responsive
- Style your app as you wish
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- Add personas and user stories to create an Interview with a user of your product for an MVP
- Add arrow key integration instead of clicking the tile
- Add google photos / giphy integration to let a user select an image via search within app
- Fade the board to all black tiles after 5 seconds after shuffle to work as a memory game
- Show css transition animation when you click the tile / shuffle the board
- Allow the [puzzle to be any dimensions based on the aspect ratio of the image (6x6, 5x4, 2x10, etc)](https://malaysia.timbangharga.com/cf/700/cdn/HTB17dx8m4PI8KJjSspfq6ACFXXaB/Tetris-worlds-Sliding-Puzzle-Colorful-Wooden-Tangram-Brain-Teaser-Puzzle-Toys-Game-for-Baby-Child-Kids.jpg)
- Allow the [tiles to be any dimension (1x2, L, etc)](https://www.michaelfogleman.com/rush/)
- Allow the [tiles to be any shape (triangle, hexagon, etc)](https://wittingen-puzzels.jimdo.com/)
- Make [2048](https://play2048.co/)
- Make a [Rubik's Cube](https://www.google.com/logos/2014/rubiks/iframe/index.html)

#### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
